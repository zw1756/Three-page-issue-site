          A real estate salesman in Valparaiso, Ind.
          A former line cook from the Bronx.
          An evangelical pastor and his wife in Huntington Beach, Calif.
          A high school student in the Milwaukee suburbs.<br><br>
          They are among the millions of amateur traders collectively taking on some of Wall Street’s most sophisticated
          investors — and,
          for the moment at least, winning. Propelled by a mix of greed and boredom, gleefully determined to teach Wall
          Street a lesson,
          and turbocharged by an endless flow of get-rich-quick hype and ideas delivered via social media,
          these investors have piled into trades around several companies,
          pushing their stock prices to stratospheric levels.

          Beginning last summer, GameStop shares started to rise after an investment firm owned by Ryan Cohen — founder
          of Chewy,
          the online pet supplies shop, whose stock was popular with retail investors — bought a stake in the company
          and joined its board.
          Around the same time, some hedge funds were betting that GameStop’s stock would plummet.
          The company had been reeling from consumers’ shifts to online commerce and streaming,
          but the pandemic was bruising it further.
