      <div class="branchContent"> Average Joe investors, coordinated on Reddit, have roughly
        quadrupled the stock price of the struggling video game retailer GameStop (GME) over
        the past two weeks in a trading frenzy that has cost traditional Wall Street hedge funds
        millions of dollars and turned GME into something of a meme on social media platforms.
        <br><br>The GameStop surge is making headlines because it’s being driven by retail
        investors — individuals who buy and sell stocks for their own gains,
        as opposed to professional investors working on Wall Street — on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets (WSB),
        a community 2.9 million-strong that refers to members as “degenerates” and idolizes Elon Musk.

        These retail investors have beaten Wall Street at its own game, at least temporarily.
        It works like this: Many hedge funds have taken short positions in companies like GameStop,
        in which they borrow shares of the stock at a certain price under the expectation
        that its market value will be worth less when it’s time to actually pay for those borrowed shares.
        In other words, they are betting on the stock price dropping.
        <br><br>
        But Redditors are snapping up shares and stock options in GameStop en masse,
        knowing their momentum together is sending the stock price up. In turn,
        Wall Street pros betting against the stock have to run and cover that short position by buying the stock as well.
        That increases demand for the shares, which increases the price even more.
        <br><br>
        This so-called “short squeeze” isn’t unusual, says Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
         “It happens all the time, but it doesn’t tend to play out in this public or dramatic a manner.”
         <br><br>
         For some followers of the subreddit, buying GameStop stock is both a troll of the hedge funds they call “parasites,”
         and a real attempt at making big bucks. Along the way, the users have been encouraged by Musk and fellow billionaire
         Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of venture capital firm Social Capital.
